# Ethernet

Poppy is configured to obtain a IP adress via DHCP when he is connected to the lrz network with an ethernet cable.
The DNS Service [poppy.clients.ldv.ei.tum.de](http://poppy.clients.ldv.ei.tum.de) is configured only for Wifi connections to the LDV-CPP network bridge.

# Wifi
Poppy automatically connects to the Wifi SSID: **LDV-CPP**

The LDV-CPP accesspoints work in bridge-mode so Poppy can be reached by: [poppy.clients.ldv.ei.tum.de](http://poppy.clients.ldv.ei.tum.de) 
This only works when the accesspoint is connected to the lrz network.
