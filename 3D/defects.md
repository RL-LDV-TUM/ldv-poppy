# Broken Parts
Most parts have a very tight fit. Therefore, some narrow structures break when higher tension occures. This happens because the space for the motors is too small or
the weight of the robot is to high. 

## Knee
The knee split up at a very narrow cover of the motor. This does not effect the payload because the part is held together by the motor itself.
However the crack does not look very nice.

On the other knee also the lower part has cracks in it. These were caused by the screws and an uneven print result.

## Ankle
The ankle has to be printed this way so that to motor plate fits through. Unfortunately, this causes the upper screws to be literally useless.

## Pelvis
Due to hugh stress on this part, the pelvis broke in half at a printing layer. 
A new version of the pelvis is now employed in the robot which is 3mm thicker at each side.

## Upper Arm
The upper arm suffered the same error as the knee. The narrow plate covering the motor was already thickened an reprinted.
The range of this plate is limited by the shouled part and can not be increased much further.

# Print Orientation
As the pelvis shows, printed parts are **vunerable where the filament layers are connected**. It is very unlikely that a layer itself will break.
Therefore, it is important that the object is printed in a way that later on no big forces will tear the different layers apart.
The main forces should never appear orthogonal to the layers, but alway **parallel**.

Unfortunately some parts are not feasable to be printed in that way.

## Chest
The chest is the biggest part of the robot. According to the forces it would be optimally printed standing upright.
Also the designers placed the grip in a way that the original model can not be printed lying without a huge amount of support strucutres.
The outcome of an upright print was not usable, so that the model had to be redesigned to be printed lying.

## Pelvis
The lying position has its advantages for the adhesion of the object.
The thin parts of the pelvis show that this is not feasable for this part.

## Spine
One has to deal with the higher forces on the layers when the part is printed in the only possible standing position.
This can be done by increasing the thickness of the part where it does not affect the degrees of freedom of the motors.
The Spine before and after the increas of the outer walls.
